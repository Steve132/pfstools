.SH NAME
pfsview \- Viewer for high-dynamic range images in pfs format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pfsview
[--window_min <log_lum>] [--window_max <log_lum>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
pfsview is a QT application for viewing high-dynamic range images. It
expects pfs stream on the standard input and displays the frames in
that stream one by one.

\fBpfsv\fR script can be more convienent to use if hdr images are to be
displayed without any prior processing.

.SH DYNAMIC RANGE WINDOW
To show high-dynamic range data on a low-dynamic range monitor,
pfsview uses concept of a dynamic range window. The dynamic range
window is the highest and lowest value that should be mapped to black
and white pixel. Values above or below the window are clipped (see
clipping methods below). The dynamic range window is displayed in
pfsview as a blue area on the dynamic range scale (second toolbox from
the top). The window can be moved, shrunk and expended using a mouse
or a keyboard.

.SH CLIPPING METHODS

Currently, two clipping methods are available (see View menu):

.TP
Simple clipping
The values above and below the dynamic range window are displayed as
black or white.

.TP
Color-coded clipping
The values above the dynamic range window are displayed as yellow and
below the window as green. This is helpful to see which parts of the
image do not fit into the selected dynamic range.

.TP
Keep brightness and hue
This method tries to preserve brightness and
hue while sacrificing color saturation when the colors exceed the RGB
color gamut. Colors are desaturated in the RGB color space towards the
neutral color (D65) of the corresponding luminance.

.SH MAPPING METHODS

High-dynamic range data are usually better visualized using non-linear
scale, for example a logarithmic or a power function. pfsview offers
several such scales, shown in \fIView\fR menu. Gray-scale values for
each mapping method are computed by the formulas:

\fBLINEAR\fR: y = (x-min)/(max-min)

\fBGAMMA\fR: y = [ (x-min)/(max-min) ]^gamma

\fBLOGARITHMIC\fR: y = (log10(x)-log10(min))/(log10(max)-log10(min))

where \fIy\fR is the gray-scale value after mapping, \fIx\fR
is an input HDR value, \fImin\fR and \fImax\fR are lower and upper bounds
of the dynamic range window.


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
--window_min <log_lum>

Lower bound of the values that should be displayed or minimum value of
the dynamic range window. The value should be given in log_10 units,
for example -1 if the lower bound should be 0.1 (10^-1).

.TP
--window_max <log_lum>
Upper bound of the values that should be displayed or minimum value of
the dynamic range window. The value should be given in log_10 units,
for example -1 if the upper bound should be 0.1 (10^-1).

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
pfsin memorial.hdr | pfsview 
See the memorial image.

.TP
pfsv memorial.hdr
The same as above, but using the utility script 'pv'.
