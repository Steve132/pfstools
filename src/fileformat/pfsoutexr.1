.SH NAME
pfsoutexr \- Write images or frames in OpenEXR format
.SH SYNOPSIS

.B pfsoutexr
[--compression <method>] [--float32] [--clamp-halfmax] (<file> [--frames <range>])  [<file>...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Use this command to write frames in OpenEXR format. Source pfs frames
should be piped to the Standard Input. This command can write arbitrary
channels to OpenEXR as 32-bit floating point numbers. However, color channels are converted to 16-bit half-float format by default unless \fB--float32\fR option is specified.

All tags from pfs stream are stored in an OpenEXR file as String
attributes. Tags assigned to channels are stored in the format
<channel_name>:<tag_name>, so that pfsinexr can later restore tags in
the appropriate channels.

The depth channel \fIDEPTH\fR is renamed to \fIZ\fR to keep
compatibility with \fBpfsinexr\fR. If the luminance is absolute (tag
\fILUMINANCE\fR set to \fIABSOLUTE\fR), \fIWhiteLuminance\fR attribute
in OpenEXR file is set to 1.

Details on the format of the pattern
file names, which are used for saving multiple frames, can be found in the
manual page of pfsoutppm.

.TP
.B \--compression <method>, -c <method>
Use one the the available compression methods:

\fBNO\fR - no compression

\fBRLE\fR - run length encoding

\fBZIPS\fR - zlib compression, one scan line at a time

\fBZIP\fR - zlib compression, in blocks of 16 scan lines

\fBPIZ\fR - piz-based wavelet compression (default)

\fBPXR24\fR - lossy 24-bit float compression

.TP
.B \--float32, -3
If this option is specified, color channels are stored as 32-bit floating point numbers instead of 16-bit half-floats. In most cases half-float numbers offer sufficient precision so this the default behavior. Note that storing color channels in 32-bit format makes resulting files very large. 

.TP
.B \--clamp-halfmax, -p
The maximum value that can be stored in OpenEXR file is limited to
65504 if 16-bit HALF float is used (color channels are stored by
default in this format unless \fB--float32\fR switch is
specified). If the luminance data is calibrated in absolute values
(cd/m^2), pixel values can easily exceed 65504. To avoid clamping
large pixel values, pfsoutexr rescales data to the range that is
valid for 16-bit HALF float format and the scale factor used for rescaling is stored in OpenEXR file
as OpenEXR standard attribute \fIWhiteLuminance\fR, so that pfsinexr
can later restore the absolute values. Use the option \fB--clamp-halfmax\fR to disable this behavior and clamp half-float values instead.

.SH BUGS
pfsinexr and pfsoutexr can not take stdin / stdout as an input/output
(dash '-' instead of file name).
