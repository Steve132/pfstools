.TH "pfsintiff" 1
.SH NAME
pfsintiff \- Load images or frames in several variants of TIFF format
(both LDR and HDR)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pfsintiff
(<file> [--linear] [--frames <range>] [--skip-missing])  [<file>...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I pfsintiff
command loads images in TIFF format and writes \fIpfs\fR
stream to the Standard Output. The \fIpfs\fR stream is usually piped
to another program for further processing. To detect the format
automatically based on the extension, use \fIpfsin\fR command.
.PP
Both the standard LDR tiff and extended HDR (logLuv
encoding http://www.anyhere.com/gward/pixformat/tiffluv.html); Note
that both LDR and HDR tiff files provide photometric data (ie linearly
related to luminance). The 'LUMINANCE' tag is set to 'RELATIVE', also
the '--linear' switch is ignored.
.PP
To read images from standard input use a single dash '-' instead of
filename. The images are read until EOF is reached.
.PP
Each file can contain a \%%d pattern, which is substituted with frame
numbers. The pattern has the same syntax as C
.I printf
command. For example, you can use \%%04d to make the frame number
four digit with proceedings zeros. You can select the frames using the
following options (the options must be always given after the file
name):

.TP
.B \--frames <range>
Range is given in mathlab / octave format:

.B "startframe:step:endframe"

Frame numbers start with
.B "startframe"
(default 0), are increased by
.B "step"
(default 1) and stop at
.B "endframe"
You can skip one of those values, for example
.I "1:100"
for frames 1,2,...,100 and
.I 0:2:
for frame 0,2,4,... up to the last file that exists.

.TP
.B \--skip-missing
Skip up to ten frames in a row if corresponding files are
missing. Otherwise the program stops reading sequence at the first
file that does not exists. This switch does not apply to the first
frame in a sequence. This switch can be useful if there is a rendered
animation where some of the frame has not been generated.

.TP
.B \--linear
Ignored for compatibility with \fIpfsinppm\fR.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
pfsintiff frame\%%04d.tif \--frames 0:10 | pfsview

Read frames from files frame0000.tif, frame0001.tif, ...,
frame0010.tif and show them using pfsview.
